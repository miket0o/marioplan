This project is a continuation of The Net Ninja's course for firebase, react and redux. For now I have made it a full CRUD application. To run this file pull the repository. Go to the root directory and run npm install. After that create your own firebase account and app and create a .env file in the root directory and populate it like so.
 
REACT_APP_API_KEY=#####

REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=######

REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=######

REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=#####

REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=######

REACT_APP_APP_ID==######

After that just run npm start in the root directory. Create an account and then populate the database so you can test out the delete, edit and create project functions.

<!-- Note: I think you should also call firebase deploy --only functions because this project uses cloud functions. -->
